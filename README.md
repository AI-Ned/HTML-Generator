# HTML-Generator
My aim is to create a Python application that will allow people to write an Blog / News article, Once the article is "Submitted" it will generate a HTML file based upon a selected HTML template.

The idea here is not to create a webpage styling tool, but to create a tool that uses a HTML Template that has already been created. The HTML article page should be intergrated into the desired website seemlessly.  This is so when it comes to updating a website you don't have to continuosly edit / write the HTML. 

Non main objective - It would also be able to update existing HTML files so the link to the new article page can be added, this is not required.
